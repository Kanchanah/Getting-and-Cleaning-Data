###The Codebook## The Source of the Original Datasethttps://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip## The site where the full description can be foundhttp://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones##The Steps1.	Merge the test and training datasets to create one dataset. This is named as data1.2.	Use only the measurements on mean and standard deviation for each measurement. The extracted dataset is named as data2.3.	Read the activities_labels.txt file and append the activities names in data2.4.	Label the dataset with the appropriate descriptive names where brackets are removed, names are converted to lower case and several short forms are replaced with proper long forms.5.	The average of each variable for each activity and each subject is written to a text file called tidydata.txt##The Variables1)	testdata – contents of X_test.txt2)	traindata - contents of X_train.txt3)	mergeddataset – combined dataset of variables testdata and traindata4)	features – contents of features.txt5)	testsubject – contents of subject_test.txt6)	trainsubject – contents of subject_train.txt7)	mergedsubject - combined dataset of variables testsubject and trainsubject8)	testactivitylabels – contents of y_test.txt9)	trainactivitylabels – content of y_train.txt10)	mergedactivitylabels - combined dataset of variables testactivitylabels and trainactivitylabels11)	 data1 – combined columns of mergeddataset, mergedactivitylabels and mergedsubject12)	m – contains the columns that contains the measurements on the mean and standard deviation13)	selectedColumns- contains the column names that contains the measurements on the mean and standard deviation14)	selectedNames – containes the combination of the selected_columns, subjects and activities columns15)	data2 – contains the subset of data1 that contains columns selected using selectedNames variable416)	activities – contents of activity_labels.txt17)	 data –The dataset required by the project##The Output# tidydata.txtThis human readable dataset contains 180 rows and 68 columns 1)	The first column contains the subject IDs.2)	The second column contains the activity names3)	The averages for each of the attributes are in columns 3 to 68
